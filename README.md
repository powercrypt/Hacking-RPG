* Run

Roll 1d6 once for each hacking attribute, you can reroll your character but you have to reroll every hacking attribute if you do. When you start a scenario you have all of the relavent points available to you. The game masters job is to assign a difficulty score for the scenario which depends on the type of server.  

Roll two dice to begin, yes just like street craps. 
You get to decide which attribute you are using.

You score a point on the system if you roll 7 or 11. 

If a 2, 12, or 3 come up you lose that round. 

When you lose a round, erase one of your points in the attribute you used.

If you roll another number that is not one of the above, it becomes your target number.  

Keep rolling until you hit your magic target number again, in which case you win a point. 

Or, if you roll a 7 before you hit your point number, then you lose a point in the attribute.

When this happens you lose a point in paranoia, but can still try again.  

If your paranoia drops to zero you have to run, but if you make it to the next scenario your paranoia will recharge.

When you are forced to run you can't go back to the system you were on. 

You have as many chances to run as your run score. But your run score never recharges.

If you fail to run its GAME OVER.

After you root a system you own it and can install malware or add it to your bot net.  This will help you on your next mission. On your next mission your main hacker attributes go back up to their normal levels, but you don't gain XP.  In this game your score is your business, money.

You can steal money from hacking to upgrade your computer and internet connection.

Servers also have interesting information and clients will pay you to access that information.
