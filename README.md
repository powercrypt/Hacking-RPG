# Hacking-RPG
The ultimate role playing game for hackers.

Rules

To make your character you will need to roll 1d6 once for each hacking attribute, you can reroll your character but you have to reroll every hacking attribute if you do. When you start a scenario you have all of the relevant points available to you.The GMs job is to assign a difficulty score for the scenario, depending on the type of server. You can choose what scenario you want to run, but you have to have the prerequisites which are in parenthesis next to the name of every scenario. You decide which of the allowable attributes to use, and roll two dice to begin a scenario, yes just like street craps.

You score a point on the system if you roll 7 or 11. If a 2, 12, or 3 come up you lose that round. If that doesn't happen roll the ice again and get another number that becomes your point number. 

Keep rolling until you hit your magic point number again, in which case you win. Or, if you roll a 7 before you hit your point number, then you lose. After the roll is decided you erase one point in the attribute you were using, and for every failure you also lose a point in paranoia. 

If your paranoia drops to zero you have to run, but if you make it to the next scenario your paranoia will recharge with newly boosted confidence. If however you are forced to run you won't be able to go back to the system you were on. If you fail to run you permanetely lose one dot of run points (None if you succeed). However, your run score never recharges. If you fail to run don't have anymore points its GAME OVER

After you root a system you are awarded 1d6 experience point that you can spend on your attributes.  Installing malware creates a backdoor to the system after the mission ends, allowing you to watch logs of what happens on the network. Each server you have in your botnet acts as a proxy, giving you an extra dot in paranoia. You can transfer money to upgrade your computer and internet connection. Servers also have interesting information that clients will be happy to pay you for.

      Hacking on a phone requires 2 extra successes for every scenario
      Hacking on a tablet requires 1 extra successes for every scenario
      Hacking on a personal computer requires nothing extra          
      Hacking on a server requires 1 less successes for every scenario
      Hacking on a mainframe requires 2 less successes for every scenario

      An open system gets two automatic successes that can be used once every mission
      A vulnerable system gets one automatic success that can be used once every mission
      A secure system gets no bonus

      A slow connection requires 1 extra success every scenario
      A regular connection doesn't change anything
      A high speed connection gets 1 automatic successes every scenario
      A dedicated connection gets 2 automatic successes every scenario
